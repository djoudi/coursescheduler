<h2 class="style3">Course Schedule Creator</h2>

<p><b>Overview</b></p>

<p>This web based software is designed to simplify making changes to dates in course calendars. It displays the calendar in a table of rows with each row representing 1 week. The number of weeks displayed is a chosen variable, though a typical Fall or Spring semester is 16 weeks, and Summer semester 8 weeks. Unlimited lessons and assignments with due dates may be added to columns in a given week.</p>

<p>Dates entered for Assignments Due create a stored factor based on the start date of the course. This means all assignments remain the same length of time from the start date no matter what the start date is. Thus changing the start date changes all dates in the calendar.</p>

<p>Changing Semester between Fall & Spring inserts Spring  & Thanksgiving breaks in the proper week and alters all Lesson and Assignment dates accordingly.</p>

<p>Different color schemes can be chosen which alter the styling of the final display.</p>

<h3 class="style3">Course Schedule Creator - the starting page</h3>
